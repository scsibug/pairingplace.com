<h1 style="font-size:1.5em">We are collecting short descriptions of programming tasks, to help us make recommendations for pairing programmers on open source projects.  We would like your assistance, by describing real programming tasks.  The following examples and guidelines should help show you what we're after.</h1>

<h2>Examples:</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Add friction, jitter, and oscillating gravity to a particle simulation iPhone application, in Objective-C."</li><li>"Create a feedparser-style library for Clojure, that can parse RSS and Atom feeds into native data structures."</li><li>"Support object versioning in hS3, the Haskell API to Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3)."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidelines:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Succinct</strong> descriptions, under 140 characters is ideal.</li><li><strong>Specific</strong> technologies or frameworks are listed.</li><li><strong>Understandable</strong> with no more context than just the description.</li><li><strong>Valuable</strong> to others (these tasks should not be solely about your own learning).</li><li><strong>Small</strong>, something that could be reasonably achieved in ~4 hours by a couple motivated people.</li><li><strong>Testable</strong>, it should be clear when the task is accomplished.</li><li><strong>Real</strong>, from an existing open source project, either something you've wanted, done, or seen done.  If at all possible, please cite the project, issue, or commit in the "Reference" field.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Please submit this form once for each task description you can come up with.  Forward to any programmers you think want to help!  Thank you.</h3>
